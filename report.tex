\section{Introduction}

Jasmin\cite{10.1145/3133956.3134078, 10.1145/3319535.3363211, 9152665} is a
compiler and a language designed for writing high-assurance and
high-speed cryptography primitives. The semantics is formally defined to allow
rigorous reasoning about program behaviors.
The Jasmin language is close to assembly, the main differences lie in:
\begin{itemize}
\item Jasmin abstracts numerical operations common in cryptography
\item Jasmin provides variables and performs variable allocation in registers
\item Jasmin supports arrays
\item Jasmin provides common control flow statements
\item Jasmin provides functions with support for C calling convention if needed
\item Jasmin presents assembly instruction with a functional style to avoid
hidden side effects
\end{itemize}

In Jasmin there are two kind of variables, the stack allocated ones and the
register allocated ones. The user has to tell the compiler the kind of every
variables. This also holds true for arrays. However on most processors on which
people run cryptographic primitives and software, there is no hardware support
for indexing registers with a value, all registers need to be known at
compilation. In Jasmin a compilation step does it.

\medskip

In most programming languages, arrays are an abstraction for handling memory
using integers. It abstracts contiguous memory into a partial map from integers
to memory cells in order to hide arithmetic on pointers. This abstraction could
also be thought as a partial map from integers to variables, that is any array
\(t\) of size \(N\) could be replaced by \(N\) variables
\(t_0, \dots, t_{N - 1}\) and a pair of functions
\((\mathit{get}, \mathit{set})\) such that \(\mathit{get} : k \mapsto t_k\) and
\(\mathit{set}\;k\;x\) sets \(t_k\) to \(x\).

This way of thinking about arrays allows us to eliminate Jasmin register arrays
by replacing them by variables. This compilation step is called array expansion
and is not a standard compilation step. In the following array expansion will
also refer to the action of eliminating arrays by replacing them with the
appropriate amount of variables.

\medskip

In this article we try to extend the array expansion step the Jasmin compiler
already performs. In particular we implemeted array expansion in function
signature and function calls, and we studied how more array expansion could be
performed in particular for slice assignments informed by how the expansion of
whole arrays in function call works.

This article is organised as follows:
In Section \ref{sec:syntax} the relevant parts of Jasmin syntax trees are
presented then the syntactic side of array expansion is explained more in-depth
for our intended use in Jasmin.
In Section \ref{sec:semantics} the relevant parts of Jasmin semantics are
presented then the semantics side of array expansion is explored.
In Section \ref{sec:perch} we describe and justify a change we made to the core
of Jasmin semantics and the consequent changes we had to make in order to
accomodate it and fix the correctness theorems.

\section{Array expansion compiler pass}\label{sec:syntax}

\subsection{Introduction to relevant parts of Jasmin syntax}

In this section, the relevant parts of Jasmin programs' AST type is described.
The irrelevant parts, if mentioned, will not be expanded upon. Most of the types
are described in Figure \ref{fig:types} using a mix of a mathematical and
OCaml-like syntax.

A Jasmin progam is a list of functions. A function is made of its name, a unique
identifier; its parameters, a list of variables; its body, a list of
instructions; its returned variables, a list of variables; and its kind. The
kind of a function can be ``exported to the outside'', in which case the
function must follow some calling convention, or internal (subroutine).

\smallskip

An instruction can be an assignment or a function call. Other instructions
include assembly instructions and control flow instructions, however they are
not relevant to our work.

An assignment is made of an lvalue and an expression. A function call is
made of the called function identifier, a list of lvalues matching the
function returned variables list on length, and a list of expressions matching
the function parameters list on length.

Function arguments and return variables, lvalues and expressions refer to
variables. A variable is made of an identifier, a type and a kind. In the AST a
variable doesn't have to be declared in order to be used. Across a function
body, parameters and returned variables, all variables featuring the same
identifier and type are considered to be the same. A variable kind is a
constraint on where the compiler can store the value, it is either on the stack
or in a register.

\smallskip

An lvalue indicates where to store a value, it is either a variable
(\texttt{Lvar} constructor), a cell of an array variable (\texttt{Laset}), a
slice of an array variable (\texttt{Lasub}) or nowhere (\texttt{Lnone})
indicating the value will not be used and can be discarded as soon as possible.

An expression can be a constant word (\texttt{Pconst}), an empty array with no
initialised cell (\texttt{Parr\_init}), a variable (\texttt{Pvar}), a cell of an
array variable (\texttt{Pget}) or a slice of an array variable (\texttt{Psub}).
Operations like the addition of two expressions are also expressions.

Single array cells are indexed by expressions. Slice are contiguous sections of
arrays. The section is described using its length and offset from the begining
of the array. The length is a non-negative number and the offset an expression.

\smallskip

Arrays and words are two Jasmin types. A word is two to a non-negative power,
representing the size of the word in bytes. An array is a partial map from
non-negative numbers to words of some size.

\subsection{Array expansion in Jasmin compiler}

A variable of type array and kind register means an array of registers, but in
most common processors on which cryptographic primitives are run there is no
hardware support for indexing registers with a register. Therefore we need to
eliminate them in some compilation step; this is what the array expansion step
does in the Jasmin compiler. Other kind of arrays are not expanded --even though
we could try to expand them-- because there is hardware support for indexing
memory with a register and so we consider users know what they want.

In order to expand an array we have to replace all store and load operations
performed on this array and modify function signature it appears in. The load
and store operations (resp. in expressions and lvalues) come in three kinds:
single cell indexing, array slicing and whole array access.

\smallskip

Assume we have a map associating each array to the list of variables it is
expanded to (called \texttt{m} in the following figures; as all array length are
known in Jasmin it is just a matter of generating enough fresh names).

\medskip

~ | Pvar x       \(\mapsto\) if v\_ty x is Arr \_ \_

~ | Psub len x e \(\mapsto\) Ok [:: Pget v (Padd e (Pconst U64 i)) | 0 \(\leq\) i \(<\) n ]

\caption{Expansion for unrolling expressions and lvalues.}\label{fig:unrexp}
\end{figure}

The array expansion for expressions and lvalues are depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:fullexp} using a pseudo OCaml-like syntax for convenience.
In this figure and all the following, \texttt{Let} \textit{pat} \texttt{=}
\textit{e1} \texttt{in} \texttt{e2} is a shorthand for matching the result of
\textit{e1} against \texttt{Ok} \textit{pat} and \texttt{Error}; in the former
case the relevant variables of \textit{pat} are bound and \textit{e2} is
evaluated, in the latter case the expression evaluates to \texttt{Error}.

The figure doesn't describe actual implemented code because expansion of
variables and subarrays for assignments is performed in a previous compilation
step\footnote{Prior to our work, single cell access for lvalues and expression
in assignments was implmented in the array expansion step and variable expansion
was implemented in a previous compilation step}, but they could all be
implemented in one compiler step as the code required to expand expressions and
lvalues for function calls and assignment only differs slightly as will be shown
further in this section.

\smallskip

Single cell indexing (\texttt{Pget} and \texttt{Laget}) can be expanded to a
single variable (\texttt{Pvar} and \texttt{Lvar}) when the index is a constant.
Otherwise it is not supported. When the index is a for loop variable in the
original program, the loop unrolling and constant propagation steps which come
before the array expansion step have already transformed the indexes into
constants, so it also falls under the constant case.

Array slices (\texttt{Psub} and \texttt{Lasub}) are expanded by acceding to
the relevant slice of variables replacing the array provided the offset
parameter is a constant. The operation performed on this slice will then require
an unrolling.

Finally whole array accesses (\texttt{Pvar} and \texttt{Lvar}) are equivalent to
slices of arrays with no offset and same length as the base array on which they
are performed. They are replaced by all the variables the array is to be
replaced with.

\smallskip

In order to perform the unrolling we need to know whether an expansion was
performed in expressions and lvalues because an array may have been expanded in
one but not in the other, and only looking at the length of the expanded
expressions and lvalues isn't sufficient as arrays can be of length one.

For instance when expanding an assignment between a single cell register array
and a single cell stack array, the register array will be expanded to a list of
one expression or lvalue (depending on which side of the assignment it is),
which by the length alone doesn't tell whether it was expanded or not, and we
should know that because in one case nothing is done and in the other the
assignment is unrolled, that is the array on the other side is replaced with an
access to its only cell.

The expansion for unrolling expressions and lvalues (no array expansion
performed) is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:unrexp} with the functions
\texttt{expand\_e\_n} and \texttt{expand\_lv\_n} to expand expressions and
lvalues when the other side expansion is of length \texttt{n}.

The expansions performed for unrolling array variables and slices consist in
accessing the relevant cells. The only other case where an unrolling makes sense
is the nowhere (\texttt{Lnone}) lvalue, which is the only one requiring a length
to know how many times it should be duplicated.

\end{figure}

Array expansion for function signatures and argument expressions and
returned values lvalues in function calls are depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:sigexp}.

The expansion of an array in function signature is simply a matter of replacing
it with the variables it is expanded to. A slight subtelty however is that like
expansion for expressions and lvalues we need to know which variables were
expanded in order to expand (sometimes without actual array expansion as
illustrated in \texttt{expand\_arg} and \texttt{expand\_ret}) arguments and
return assignments accordingly.

~     Ok [:: Ccall xs fn es ]
\normalfont%
\caption{Expansion of instructions.}\label{fig:insexp}
\end{figure}

\smallskip

The expansion in function signature is only wanted when the function is not
exported to other programs because we do not want to make such changes unbeknown
to the user. Two solution satisfy this constraint\footnote{If register array
were allowed in exported functions by the typechecker}: warning the user or
failing to compile. As the global correction theorem only mentions exported
functions it would have to be complexified in order to reflect signature
expansion if we chose the former solution so we chose the latter.

\medskip

Expansion of instructions is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:insexp}. As
described previously assignment are expanded by expanding each side of the
assignment and unrolling if necessary and function calls are expanded using
informating gathered while expanding the signature, which means signature
expansion needs to be performed first on every function before expanding the
body of any function.

In this section, the relevant parts of Jasmin semantics are described. None of
it is part of our contribution but it is necessary in order to understand
the main properties we have to prove for the compiler correctness theorem.

Jasmin values can be words and partially defined arrays of words. Variable
values are stored in contexts using the dependent type \texttt{sem\_t} as
defined in Figure \ref{fig:oldval} in order to keep the invariant
\texttt{m.[x] = Ok v\(\implies\)type\_of\_val v = v\_ty x}.

\end{figure}

The semantics of expressions and lvalues are illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:semelv}.

Semantics of expressions is a partial function (\texttt{sem\_pexpr}) taking a
context and an expression and returning a value. The semantics of a constant is
the constant word with the same value. The semantics of an empty array is the
array value where no indices are defined. The semantics of a variable is the
value associated to that variable in the context. The semantics of indexing an
array variable (\texttt{Pget x e}) is the word at the index given by the
semantics of the index expression (\texttt{e}) of the array associated to the
variable (\texttt{x}) in the context. The semantics of an array slice
\texttt{Psub len x e} is the array value obtained by slicing the array
associated to the variable \texttt{x} in the context, slice of length
\texttt{len} and starting at the offset given by the semantics of the offset
expression \texttt{e}.

Semantics of lvalues is a partial function (\texttt{write\_lval}) taking an
lvalue, a value and a context, and returning a context.
The semantics of the nowhere (\texttt{Lnone}) is the unchanged context. The
semantics of a variable (\texttt{Lvar x}) is the context where the variable
(\texttt{x}) is associated to the given value. The semantics of indexing an
array variable (\texttt{Laset x e}) is the context where the array associated
to the variable (\texttt{x}) has its cell given by the semantics of the index
expression (\texttt{e}) associated to the given value. The semantics of slicing
an array variable (\texttt{Lasub len x e}) is the context where the array
variable (\texttt{x}) is associated to an array which \texttt{len} cells
starting from the index given by the semantics of the offset expression
(\texttt{e}) are associated to the \texttt{len} cells from the array value
given.

\caption{Simplified inductive big step semantics rules.}\label{fig:semall}
\end{figure}

The semantics of Jasmin functions and instructions in a program \texttt{P} are
defined as the big step inductive predicates \texttt{sem\_call} and
\texttt{sem\_i} as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:semall}. The former relates a
function and its arguments to the returned values, the latter relates a context
and an instruction to the context after executing the instruction. The semantics
for instructions is naturally extanded to a sequence of instructions in
predicate \texttt{sem} by chaining the contexts (\textsc{Eseq}) with the empty
sequence being the identity on contexts (\textsc{Eskip}).

\smallskip

The semantics of a function call is made of only one rule with four premisses:
the function identifier is bound to a function (\texttt{f}) of the program,
binding this function arguments to the parameters in an empty context gives a
valid context (\texttt{vm1}), the semantics of sequences of instructions
(\texttt{sem}) relates this valid context and the function body to another
context (\texttt{vm2}) and in this latter context the values associated to the
return variables of the function correspond to the return values of the jugement.

\smallskip

The semantics of an instruction is made of two rules. The rule for assignment
(\textsc{Eassgn}) gives the semantics of assignment instructions
(\texttt{Cassgn x e}), it has two premisses: the semantics of the assignment
expression (\texttt{e}) in the initial context (\texttt{vm1}) is a value
(\texttt{v}) and the semantics of the assignment lvalue (\texttt{x}) on the
initial context (\texttt{vm1}) and that value (\texttt{v}) correspond to the
final context (\texttt{vm2}) of the jugement. The rule for function calls
(\textsc{Ecall}) gives the semantics of the call instruction
(\texttt{Ccall xs f es}), it has three premisses: the semantics of the argument
expressions (\texttt{es}) in the initial context (\texttt{vm1}) are values
(\texttt{vargs}), the semantics of function call relates the function
(\texttt{f}) and these values (\texttt{vargs}) to other values (\texttt{vres})

from the initial context (\texttt{vm1}), on the latter values (\texttt{vres})

\subsection{Semantic implications of array expansion}

described and their implications are discussed. Semantic preservation lemmas are
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:semlem}.

\caption{Lemmas relating the semantics before and after array expansion.}\label{fig:semlem}
\end{figure}

As values and contexts are at the core of semantics, the semantics preservation
theorem has to express relations between them and their expanded version. The
relation between a value and its expanded version --a list of values-- is
\texttt{expand\_v}, it takes a boolean argument to express whether the value
should be expanded or not. If the value is expanded then it is an array and its
expansion is the list of its cells. The relation between a context and its
expanded version is \texttt{eq\_alloc}, it takes the same information for
expanding variables as the AST expansion. The relation holds if all expanded
arrays have their cell equal to the variable to which it is expanded in the
expanded context and all the other variables are equal in both contexts.

\medskip

Assume we have a program \texttt{P1}, its expansion \texttt{P2} and the
expansion information \texttt{fexpd} gathered when expanding the function
signatures (\texttt{expand\_fsig} in Figure \ref{fig:sigexp}) formatted as a map
from functions uids to two list of option type, one matching the parameters in
length and the other the returned variables, where \texttt{None} at a position
means the parameter/returned variable at the same position is not expanded and
\texttt{Some n} means that variable is an expanded array of length \texttt{n}).

% TODO: from HERE

The semantics of a function call after array expansion should take the expanded
list of values and return the values of the expanded variables. The semantics is
preserved when if the semantics of a function call in the original program
relates a list of argument to a list of return values then the semantics of the
same function in the expanded program relates the list of expanded arguments and
return values, expansion done according to the expansion information for that
function signature.

The semantics of an instruction after array expansion should be the semantics of
the list of instructions where an assignment is transformed into a list of
instructions and a function call is transformed by changing the argument
expressions and lvalues according to its signature. The semantics is
preserved when the semantics of an instruction and its expansion on related
contexts are related contexts.

\smallskip

The semantics of an expression after array expansion is either the semantics of
the one obtained expression when no expansion was performed or the expression
was a single cell access or the list of the semantics of each expression in the
expansion for array variables and array slices. The semantics is preserved when
expanding the semantics of an expression in a context gives the semantics of
the expanded expression in a related context. Likewise for the semantics of a
lvalues, except we suppose expanded values are related and we should get
related resulting contexts.

\medskip

To prove the semantics preservation, we need to consider that array are actually
partial arrays, so we must be able to expand the whole array without raising an
error, and the target expanded variables have to be associated a value. This is
not limiting in the relation on contexts but it is in the function calls when a
new context is built. To build this new context we evaluate every argument,
including the one we expanded form a partially defined array. It is also
limiting when assigning a arrays because we may not know which cell are defined.

This problem can be solved in several different ways. We could force the array
to be completely initialised, track the initialised cells (which would require
some kind of reduction of expressiveness as otherwise it isn't computable),
store optional words instead of words in the context or allow values to be
undefined. We chose the last solution.

\smallskip

\begin{figure}[t]
\obeylines\obeyspaces\ttfamily%
type value =
| Varr s n of array s n
| Vword s  of word  s
| Vundef

let type\_of\_val = function

~ | Vword s  \_ \(\mapsto\) Word s
~ | Varr s n \_ \(\mapsto\) Arr s n
\normalfont%
\caption{New value type.}
\end{figure}

The new value type features the undefined word (arrays are always defined) and
context have been modified to store values of the new \texttt{value} type
instead of the \texttt{sem\_t} dependent type.


\section{Pervasive changes to Jasmin semantics}\label{sec:perch}

In this section the changes to incorporate undefined value are motivated and
described while uncovering some relevant simplifications used in the previous
sections.

There are two main motivations for replacing the dependent type in the contexts.
The first is to include an undefined values, which could be done by an option
type in the dependent type so the second motivation is to simplify the proofs.
Proofs on dependent type tend to be tiresome because every rewriting need to
ensure type are not violated, which in the case of dependent type means ensuring
the parameter given to the dependent type are the same. This need is eliminated
with a value type since all values are of the value type. Removing dependent
types where unnecessary and favoring decidable alternatives is also a design
choice made by SSReflect, a widespread Coq proof library used in Jasmin. The
drawbacks of not using dependent types are that invariants need to be stated and
proved manually, which is actually not that much of a drawback since the
invariants become explicit and the proof needed are usually easy to prove.

\medskip

\begin{figure}
\obeylines\obeyspaces\ttfamily%
type pword s = \{
~ pw\_size  : wsize;
~ pw\_word  : word pw\_size;
~ pw\_proof : pw\_size \(\leq\) s;
\}

type psem\_t = function
| Word s \(\mapsto\) pword s
| t      \(\mapsto\) sem\_t t
\normalfont%
\caption{\texttt{psem\_t} dependent type definition.}\label{fig:psemt}
\end{figure}

The old contexts used a dependent type to store the values, this dependent type
was either \texttt{sem\_t} or \texttt{psem\_t}. The latter described in Figure
\ref{fig:psemt} is used to store smaller words into seemingly bigger words for
a compilation step where all registers and words become 64 bits as is available
in a x86 processor. The old invariant the context maintained using the dependent
types was that the type of the variable corresponded to the type of the value
stored since the type of the value stored was the dependent type aplied to the
type of the variable, which in turn gave the invariant presented in Section
\ref{ssec:jassem}
\texttt{vm.[x] = Ok v \(\Longrightarrow\) type\_of\_val v = v\_ty x} for free.

\begin{figure}[t]
\obeylines\obeyspaces\ttfamily%
let subtype t1 t2 =
~ match t1, t2 with
~ | Word s1, Word s2 \(\mapsto\) s1 \(\leq\) s2
~ | \_,       \_       \(\mapsto\) t1 = t2

let compat\_type t1 t2 =
~ match t1, t2 with
~ | Word \_, Word \_ \(\mapsto\) true
~ | \_,      \_      \(\mapsto\) t1 = t2
\normalfont%
\caption{Type relations.}
\end{figure}

The new context store their value in the new \texttt{value} type. To account for
the two cases where we have words of the right size or of a smaller size allowed
the contexts take a type relation as parameter, this type relation is either
equality or subtyping only on words. We need to manually ensure the previous
context invariant is still maintained. However since we have undefined values we
can make the access to a variable in the context never fail, instead like for
the array previously it returns undefined for word variables and an empty array
of the right type for array variable (this is considered the undefined value for
an array) so the new invariant to maintain is
\texttt{vm.[x] \(\neq\) Vundef \(\Longrightarrow\) rel (type\_of\_val vm.[x]) (v\_ty x)}
where \texttt{rel} is the type relation parameter of the context.

~ s1 \(\leq\) s2 \(\wedge\) w1 = zero\_extend s1 w2

~ n1 = n2 \(\wedge\;\bigwedge_{i = 0}^{n1 - 1}\) if array\_get a1 i is Ok w then array\_get a2 i = Ok w else false

let value\_uincl v1 v2 =

~ | Vundef,        Vword \_ \_     \(\mapsto\) true
~ | \_,             \_             \(\mapsto\) false

~ value\_uincl x y \(\Longrightarrow\) truncate\_val ty x = Ok x' \(\Longrightarrow\)
~ \(\exists\)y', truncate\_val ty y = Ok y' \(\wedge\) value\_uincl x' y'.

Lemma set\_get vm vm' x v : vm.[x \(\gets\) v] = Ok vm' \(\Longrightarrow\)
~ vm'.[x] = if rel (type\_of\_val v) (v\_ty x) then v else truncate\_val (v\_ty x) v.

\end{figure}

The semantics of instructions and function call presented in the previous section
was simplified. In particular because of the step where all stored words become
64 bits, they are truncated to the size they are supposed to be before being
assigned and after being retrieved from the context. The truncation function
has to be extended to undefined values. There are several ways to do this
extension, but the truncation function should still verify two core properties
to do most of the proofs of semantics preservation in all compilation steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item If assigning a value to a variable in a context succeeds, then the value
  associated to the variable is either the value assigned if the relation of the
  context is satisfied between the type of the value and the type of the
  variable or it is the truncation of the value assigned to the type of the
  variable (if the type of the value is bigger than the type of the variable,
  because it is the only other case where the assignment succeeds).
\item If a value is an extension (array more defined or bigger word of same
  value) of another then truncating them to the same type preserve this
  extension relation.
\end{itemize}
The first property is needed to be able to store smaller words into 64 bits word
variables and it forces the truncation to be the identity when the truncation
type is bigger than the value type.

\begin{figure}[t]
\obeylines\obeyspaces\ttfamily%
let truncate\_val ty = function
~ | Varr s n \_ \(\mapsto\) if ty = Arr s n then Ok v else Error
~ | Vword s w  \(\mapsto\) if ty is Word s'
~   then Ok (if truncate\_word s' w is Ok w' then Vword s' w' else v) else Error
~ | Vundef     \(\mapsto\) if ty is Arr \_ then Ok Vundef else Error
\normalfont%
\caption{Truncation of values to use with the new contexts.}
\end{figure}

If we chose the truncation to be the identity in the undefined case and the
truncation of a word to a bigger size (where previously it failed) then both
properties are verified.

\medskip

With these modifications we are confident the correctness proof should be
provable. At the writing of this article the correctness proof for the register
allocation step succeeded and the proof for the register array expansion is in
progress.
